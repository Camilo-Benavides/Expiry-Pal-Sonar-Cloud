# Backend environment example for ExpiryPalNext
# Copy this file to .env and fill the values before running the backend.

# Point to a Service Account JSON file
# by setting FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH to an absolute or project-relative path. If set, the
# backend's firebase.init will try to load credentials from this file instead of env fields.
# FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=./secrets/expiry-pal-service-account.json
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=

# Directory where server will cache enriched recipe responses (if enabled)
EP_RECIPE_CACHE_DIR=./cache
EP_RECIPE_CACHE_TTL=86400

# Spoonacular API key 
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=

# Flask settings
FLASK_ENV=development
PORT=5000

# Notes:
# - After creating your `.env` file, restart the backend so python-dotenv picks up the values.
# - When using PowerShell and you need to set a single variable temporarily, you can run:
#   $env:FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
# - For persistent environment variables on Windows you can use `setx` but prefer storing
#   a local `.env` for development.
